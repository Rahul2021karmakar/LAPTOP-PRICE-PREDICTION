# LAPTOP-PRICE-PREDICTION

# # PROBLEM DEFINITION
Laptop specifications are the most important thing to determine which laptops the user
will choose. Laptop specifications are determined based on user requirements. In
addition to user needs, laptop specifications are usually also determined by the
purchasing power of the user. Of course, users will be able to choose laptop
specifications that are suitable for their needs and purchasing power.
We will make a project for Laptop price prediction. The problem statement is that if
any user wants to buy a laptop then our application should be compatible to
provide a tentative price of laptop according to the user configurations. Although it
looks like a simple project or just developing a model, the dataset we have is noisy
and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing that will drive your interest
in developing this project.

# PROJECT GOAL
To minimize the error of the predicted laptop price compare to the actual laptop price.
