# LAPTOP-PRICE-PREDICTION

# # PROBLEM DEFINITION
Laptop specifications are the most important thing to determine which laptops the user
will choose. Laptop specifications are determined based on user requirements. In
addition to user needs, laptop specifications are usually also determined by the
purchasing power of the user. Of course, users will be able to choose laptop
specifications that are suitable for their needs and purchasing power.

We are making a project for Laptop price prediction. The problem statement is that
if any user wants to buy a laptop then our application should be compatible to 
provide a tentative price for the laptop according to the user configurations.
Although it looks like a simple project or just developing a model, the dataset
we have is noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing that 
will drive your interest in developing this project.

# # PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Given different laptops features, the goal of the project is to implement a Machine Learning model that can predict laptop’s price.

The raw data (collected from kaggle) was first imported using Python’s pandas library and visualized using Python’s matplotlib and seaborn library.

Data cleaning steps were peformed such as handiling outliers, checking for balanced dataset, encoding categorical data, scaling, numerical data, etc.

Using Python’s scikit-learn library different machine learning models were implemented such as Multiple Linear Regression, RandomForest resressor and XGBoost Regressor.

The accuracy scores of these model were compared and conclusions were drawn.

# PROJECT GOAL
To minimize the error of the predicted laptop price compare to the actual laptop price.
